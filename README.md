# Spear v0.1.0

## What is Spear?

Spear is a 2D game library developed specifically for [MageRun](https://github.com/cjarv94/magerun).

Since MageRun is meant to be a top-down 2D fighting game, Spear's functionality will be geared towards that use-case.

## Progress

Version 0.1.0 is here! The beginning of a fruitful journey, I hope.

So far, there isn't much you can do. The library compiles correctly and includes versioning information, as well as a placeholder for the `sp_winit` function.
